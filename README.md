</p>

Yii 2 Advanced Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application.

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports
deploying the application in different environments.

Documentation is at [docs/guide/README.md](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/blob/master/docs/guide/README.md).
